InforLaw-thought for LLM entity extraction

The form of this method is like：
You are a master of natural lan-guage processing in the field of [X], and you are performing an entity recognition task where the types of entities include [T]. Let's think step by step. Given a text, use [L] to analyze the entire text to achieve a clear understanding. If necessary, collaborate on a discussion with three re-nowned peers.
